## 1.1

#### 1
Ordering directories of files (by name, date etc.).

#### 2
Memory efficiency can be important for many applications.
One might also consider minimising data sent across a network,
at the expense of run-time on the server itself.

#### 3
Linked lists are commonly seen in functional languages, mainly
due to how easy they are to define. One common problem in efficiency
is that appending a new value requires traversing the entire list, although
prepending a value has the same cost regardless of how long the list is. A linked
list also has more memory overhead than a contiguous block of memory containing the
same elements.

#### 4
Both problems involve minimisation, and finding the optimal paths on
some kind of map. Where they differ is in the presence of multiple trucks,
and the need to visit all nodes in the salesman problem, as opposed to being
free to choose any path, as long as it joins the two endpoints.

#### 5
It would be unacceptable for commercial planes, destined for personal travel,
to sometimes be routed to the wrong place.
However, in terms of shipping freight across planes, it's acceptable to settle with
a satisfying, but not necessarily optimal distribution of products across the planes.


## 1.2

#### 1
Consider an application that plays music. Not even acknowledging the algorithms
necessary to implement audio itself, displaying songs to the user in different
ways requires sorting.

#### 2
Between 1 and 43 elements (on this machine) insertion sort is faster.

#### 3
The smallest value is roughly 0.1.
